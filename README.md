# TTNOpt: Tree Tensor Netwokr Package for high-rank tensor compression
We have developed TTNOpt, a software package that utilizes tree tensor networks (TTNs) for quantum spin systems and highdimensional data analysis.
TTNOpt provides efficient and powerful TTN computations by **locally optimizing the network structure**, guided by the entanglement pattern of the target tensors.
